## Admin Panel
- The admin panel view is meant to handle all the orders, products, and registered users
- An order can be marked as delivered, after the user has completed the payment
- The admin can create a product for the shop, which makes it easier to add/remove more products to replicate a real world e-commerce site
- The users detail can altered, only by setting them as admin or not. Other than this, the admin cannot change any other detail about the registered user.
- Helps give an estimate of the total number of orders and users on the app.

## Technology Stack

The MERN Stack is a popular full-stack development solution that combines MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. These components seamlessly work together to create robust web applications.

## MERN Stack Components:

*MongoDB:* A flexible NoSQL database for storing data in JSON-like documents. It excels in performance, availability, and scalability, making it ideal for handling large volumes of data and complex queries.

*Express.js:* A minimalistic and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies building web APIs and handling HTTP requests, providing robust features and middleware for web and mobile applications.

*React.js:* A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially Single Page Applications (SPAs). Its component-based architecture enables code reusability and maintainability.

*Node.js:* A JavaScript runtime based on Chrome's V8 engine, enabling server-side JavaScript execution. It focuses on performance, making it perfect for scalable and efficient back-end development.
